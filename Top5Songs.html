	      <p>Back in June of this year, Softwilly teased Bloody Daisies as "Japan Song" in his teaser videos. To advertise it, the first official teaser was unveiled on August 9. It is assumed that Softwilly's brief journey to Japan, along with that of many other group chat participants, is what led to the creation of this song. When it came to this song, Softwilly only wanted to create something that sounded like the opening of an anime.</p>
